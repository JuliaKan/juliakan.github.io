		<p id="WelcomeBlue">Welcome!</p>
		<p>I've created this page so that you can get to know me a bit. I was born in New York, grew up in Albany, moved to Boston for my Bachelors and then moved to Israel to volunteer for a year. Once in Israel, I completed two Masters degrees, met my husband and had two boys.</p>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>As I have started delving into the world of coding and computer languages, I have discovered many similarities with my music background that have made me feel at home. Exploring new languages such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript remind me of my experiences learning the “universal language” of music and of learning to speak fluent Hebrew in twelve months at the age of twenty-three.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Specifically, I have found similarities regarding problem solving in both music and coding. As a violist, I have to find the correct “fingerings”, or the order of the fingers, before I play a piece. It takes time to figure out the number puzzle to find the best way to express the music. Also, as part of an orchestra or when playing in a chamber music group, I often worked together with other musicians to find the cleanest and easiest way to arrive at a musical conclusion together. We frequently had to ask ourselves, “Why is the music not balanced?” and “Why is the musical phrase not working?” I’ve been able to apply this problem solving often in coding.
